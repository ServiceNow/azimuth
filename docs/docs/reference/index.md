# Reference

Our reference is split in two sections:

1. [:material-link: Configuration](./configuration/index.md) provides detailed information about the
   different fields in the Azimuth configuration that allow to define the dataset, the pipelines and
   different customization.

2. [:material-link: Custom Objects](custom-objects/index.md) describes how to create custom objects
   that allow to add your own datasets, pipelines and metrics.
