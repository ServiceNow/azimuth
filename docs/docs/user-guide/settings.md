# Settings

## Speed-up the Start-Up

Disable behavioral testing and similarity analysis in the config file to increase the start-up
speed, as explained
in [:material-link: Behavioral Testing Configuration](../reference/configuration/analyses/behavioral_testing.md)
and [:material-link: Similarity Configuration](../reference/configuration/analyses/similarity.md). Enable
them through settings later on without restarting the app.
