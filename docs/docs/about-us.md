# About Us

We started developing Azimuth :material-telescope: at the beginning of 2021, as an internal tool at
ServiceNow. We are open-source since April 2022. Our motivation in developing this tool is to go
beyond the traditional model quality assessment based solely on high level metrics. We strongly
believe that much more can be discovered and understood from our dataset and models if we have the
right tools, visualizations and interfaces. We hope this can be helpful to you, and that you enjoy
Azimuth! :smiley:
