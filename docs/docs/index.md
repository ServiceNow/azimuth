# Welcome to the Azimuth Documentation!

![Logo](_static/azimuth_logo_universal_color.png){: style="width:650px"}

Azimuth is an open source application that helps AI practitioners and data scientists better
**understand their dataset and model predictions** by performing thorough **dataset** and **error
analyses**. The application leverages different tools, including robustness tests, semantic
similarity analysis and saliency maps, unified by concepts such as **smart tags** and **proposed
actions**.

While this version of Azimuth focuses on **NLP classification problems**, the tool could easily be
adapted to apply to other data types and models, e.g. vision or tabular use cases. However, the
current focus is on text classification.
