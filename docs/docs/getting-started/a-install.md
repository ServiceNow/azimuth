# A. Installation

Follow the steps to **install** the necessary items, and **download Azimuth**.

## Requirements

1. Install [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) :material-docker:.
    * Docker allows to use our application without installing all the dependencies.
    * You can also use Azimuth without `Docker` by installing our dependencies with `poetry`
      and `yarn`. It is slightly more complex, but it can be faster to launch Azimuth. The
      instructions are in [Development](../development/index.md).
2. [Mac Only] Setup Docker so it has **enough memory** to run Azimuth.
    1. Right-click on the Docker icon :material-docker: on the toolbar of your computer.
    2. Go to Resources and set the “Memory” slider to 9Gb or more.
    3. Click on “Apply and Restart”.
3. **Download Azimuth**'s latest release.
    1. On [GitHub :material-github:](https://github.com/ServiceNow/azimuth), git clone our repo.

    **Congratulations**! You have installed the necessary items and installed Azimuth. **Proceed
    to [Learn Basics](b-basics.md)**.
