# A. Installation

!!! tip

    You can also use Azimuth by git cloning the repo and running locally. It is slightly more
    complex but it allows you to get the latest features and edit the code. The instructions are
    [here](../development/index.md).

## Requirements

1. Install [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) :material-docker:.

2. [Mac Only] Setup Docker so it has **enough memory** to run Azimuth.
    1. Right-click on the Docker icon :material-docker: on the toolbar of your computer.
    2. Go to Resources and set the “Memory” slider to 9Gb or more.
    3. Click on “Apply and Restart”.
3. **Download Azimuth**'s latest release.
    1. On GitHub :material-github:, download the latest release in the right panel.
    2. Unzip the folder on your computer.
