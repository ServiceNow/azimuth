## [Not released]

### Added
- Meaningful error messages in the error toasts.
- Support for no dataset at startup, in which case Azimuth will wait until the user sets it up via the config UI.
- Support for customizing, adding, and removing some pipelines, postprocessors, and metrics.

### Changed
- When clicking on an utterance from the Exploration space's Utterance Table, the Utterance Details now open in a modal on top of the table. This preserves the filter context and allows for going through the utterances one by one, using some new arrow buttons or keyboard arrows.
